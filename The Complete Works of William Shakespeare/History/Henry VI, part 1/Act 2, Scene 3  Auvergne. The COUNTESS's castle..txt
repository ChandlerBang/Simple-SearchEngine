SCENE III. Auvergne. The COUNTESS's castle.
Enter the COUNTESS and her Porter
OF AUVERGNE
COUNTESS
Porter
Porter, remember what I gave in charge;
And when you have done so, bring the keys to me.
OF AUVERGNE
Madam, I will.
COUNTESS
Messenger
The plot is laid: if all things fall out right,
I shall as famous be by this exploit
As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death.
Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight,
And his achievements of no less account:
Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,
To give their censure of these rare reports.
OF AUVERGNE
Madam,
According as your ladyship desired,
By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come.
COUNTESS
Messenger
And he is welcome. What! is this the man?
OF AUVERGNE
Madam, it is.
COUNTESS
TALBOT
                  Is this the scourge of France?
Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad
That with his name the mothers still their babes?
I see report is fabulous and false:
I thought I should have seen some Hercules,
A second Hector, for his grim aspect,
And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.
Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!
It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
Should strike such terror to his enemies.
OF AUVERGNE
Madam, I have been bold to trouble you;
But since your ladyship is not at leisure,
I'll sort some other time to visit you.
COUNTESS
Messenger
What means he now? Go ask him whither he goes.
TALBOT
Stay, my Lord Talbot; for my lady craves
To know the cause of your abrupt departure.
OF AUVERGNE
Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,
I go to certify her Talbot's here.
COUNTESS
TALBOT
If thou be he, then art thou prisoner.
OF AUVERGNE
Prisoner! to whom?
COUNTESS
TALBOT
To me, blood-thirsty lord;
And for that cause I trained thee to my house.
Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,
For in my gallery thy picture hangs:
But now the substance shall endure the like,
And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,
That hast by tyranny these many years
Wasted our country, slain our citizens
And sent our sons and husbands captivate.
OF AUVERGNE
Ha, ha, ha!
COUNTESS
TALBOT
Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan.
OF AUVERGNE
I laugh to see your ladyship so fond
To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow
Whereon to practise your severity.
COUNTESS
TALBOT
Why, art not thou the man?
OF AUVERGNE
I am indeed.
COUNTESS
TALBOT
Then have I substance too.
OF AUVERGNE
No, no, I am but shadow of myself:
You are deceived, my substance is not here;
For what you see is but the smallest part
And least proportion of humanity:
I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,
It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
Your roof were not sufficient to contain't.
COUNTESS
TALBOT
This is a riddling merchant for the nonce;
He will be here, and yet he is not here:
How can these contrarieties agree?
OF AUVERGNE
That will I show you presently.
How say you, madam? are you now persuaded
That Talbot is but shadow of himself?
These are his substance, sinews, arms and strength,
With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,
Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
And in a moment makes them desolate.
COUNTESS
TALBOT
Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse:
I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited
And more than may be gather'd by thy shape.
Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath;
For I am sorry that with reverence
I did not entertain thee as thou art.
OF AUVERGNE
Be not dismay'd, fair lady; nor misconstrue
The mind of Talbot, as you did mistake
The outward composition of his body.
What you have done hath not offended me;
Nor other satisfaction do I crave,
But only, with your patience, that we may
Taste of your wine and see what cates you have;
For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well.
COUNTESS
