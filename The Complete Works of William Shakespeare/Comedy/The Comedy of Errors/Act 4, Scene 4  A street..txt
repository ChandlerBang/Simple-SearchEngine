SCENE IV. A street.
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and the Officer
OF EPHESUS
ANTIPHOLUS
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Fear me not, man; I will not break away:
I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,
To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
And will not lightly trust the messenger
That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,
I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.
Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.
How now, sir! have you that I sent you for?
OF EPHESUS
Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.
ANTIPHOLUS
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
But where's the money?
OF EPHESUS
Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.
ANTIPHOLUS
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?
OF EPHESUS
I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.
ANTIPHOLUS
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
OF EPHESUS
To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I returned.
ANTIPHOLUS
Officer
And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Good sir, be patient.
Officer
Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in adversity.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Good, now, hold thy tongue.
OF EPHESUS
Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
ANTIPHOLUS
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
ANTIPHOLUS
I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel
your blows.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an
ass.
OF EPHESUS
I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long
ears. I have served him from the hour of my
nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his
hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he
heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me
with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep;
raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with
it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when
I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a
beggar wont her brat; and, I think when he hath
lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.
ANTIPHOLUS
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.
OF EPHESUS
Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or
rather, the prophecy like the parrot, 'beware the
rope's-end.'
ANTIPHOLUS
Courtezan
Wilt thou still talk?
ADRIANA
How say you now? is not your husband mad?
LUCIANA
His incivility confirms no less.
Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;
Establish him in his true sense again,
And I will please you what you will demand.
Courtezan
Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!
PINCH
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!
OF EPHESUS
Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.
ANTIPHOLUS
PINCH
There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
OF EPHESUS
I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,
To yield possession to my holy prayers
And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!
ANTIPHOLUS
ADRIANA
Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
OF EPHESUS
O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!
ANTIPHOLUS
ADRIANA
You minion, you, are these your customers?
Did this companion with the saffron face
Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut
And I denied to enter in my house?
OF EPHESUS
O husband, God doth know you dined at home;
Where would you had remain'd until this time,
Free from these slanders and this open shame!
ANTIPHOLUS
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Dined at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?
OF EPHESUS
Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
ANTIPHOLUS
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
OF EPHESUS
Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.
ANTIPHOLUS
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
And did not she herself revile me there?
OF EPHESUS
Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.
ANTIPHOLUS
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
OF EPHESUS
Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.
ANTIPHOLUS
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
And did not I in rage depart from thence?
ADRIANA
In verity you did; my bones bear witness,
That since have felt the vigour of his rage.
PINCH
Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?
OF EPHESUS
It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,
And yielding to him humours well his frenzy.
ANTIPHOLUS
ADRIANA
Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
OF EPHESUS
Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;
But surely master, not a rag of money.
ANTIPHOLUS
ADRIANA
Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?
LUCIANA
He came to me and I deliver'd it.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
And I am witness with her that she did.
PINCH
God and the rope-maker bear me witness
That I was sent for nothing but a rope!
OF EPHESUS
Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;
I know it by their pale and deadly looks:
They must be bound and laid in some dark room.
ANTIPHOLUS
ADRIANA
Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.
ADRIANA
And, gentle master, I received no gold;
But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.
OF EPHESUS
Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
ANTIPHOLUS
ADRIANA
Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;
And art confederate with a damned pack
To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:
But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes
That would behold in me this shameful sport.
PINCH
O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.
LUCIANA
More company! The fiend is strong within him.
OF EPHESUS
Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!
ANTIPHOLUS
Officer
What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them
To make a rescue?
PINCH
                  Masters, let him go
He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
ADRIANA
Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.
Officer
What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
Do outrage and displeasure to himself?
ADRIANA
He is my prisoner: if I let him go,
The debt he owes will be required of me.
OF EPHESUS
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd
Home to my house. O most unhappy day!
ANTIPHOLUS
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
O most unhappy strumpet!
OF EPHESUS
Master, I am here entered in bond for you.
ANTIPHOLUS
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?
LUCIANA
Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good master:
cry 'The devil!'
ADRIANA
God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!
Officer
Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.
Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?
ADRIANA
One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?
Officer
I know the man. What is the sum he owes?
ADRIANA
Two hundred ducats.
Officer
Say, how grows it due?
ADRIANA
Due for a chain your husband had of him.
Courtezan
He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.
ADRIANA
When as your husband all in rage to-day
Came to my house and took away my ring--
The ring I saw upon his finger now--
Straight after did I meet him with a chain.
LUCIANA
It may be so, but I did never see it.
Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:
I long to know the truth hereof at large.
ADRIANA
God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.
Officer
And come with naked swords.
Let's call more help to have them bound again.
OF SYRACUSE
Away! they'll kill us.
ANTIPHOLUS
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I see these witches are afraid of swords.
OF SYRACUSE
She that would be your wife now ran from you.
ANTIPHOLUS
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence:
I long that we were safe and sound aboard.
OF SYRACUSE
Faith, stay here this night; they will surely do us
no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold:
methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for
the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of
me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and
turn witch.
ANTIPHOLUS
