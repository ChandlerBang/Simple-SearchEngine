SCENE I. The same.
Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
DON
MOTH
Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Concolinel.
DON
MOTH
Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years; take this key,
give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately
hither: I must employ him in a letter to my love.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?
DON
MOTH
How meanest thou? brawling in French?
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
No, my complete master: but to jig off a tune at
the tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humour
it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and
sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you
swallowed love with singing love, sometime through
the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling
love; with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of
your eyes; with your arms crossed on your thin-belly
doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in
your pocket like a man after the old painting; and
keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.
These are complements, these are humours; these
betray nice wenches, that would be betrayed without
these; and make them men of note--do you note
me?--that most are affected to these.
DON
MOTH
How hast thou purchased this experience?
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
By my penny of observation.
DON
MOTH
But O,--but O,--
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
'The hobby-horse is forgot.'
DON
MOTH
Callest thou my love 'hobby-horse'?
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your
love perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?
DON
MOTH
Almost I had.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Negligent student! learn her by heart.
DON
MOTH
By heart and in heart, boy.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
And out of heart, master: all those three I will prove.
DON
MOTH
What wilt thou prove?
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon
the instant: by heart you love her, because your
heart cannot come by her; in heart you love her,
because your heart is in love with her; and out of
heart you love her, being out of heart that you
cannot enjoy her.
DON
MOTH
I am all these three.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
And three times as much more, and yet nothing at
all.
DON
MOTH
Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
A message well sympathized; a horse to be ambassador
for an ass.
DON
MOTH
Ha, ha! what sayest thou?
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse,
for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.
DON
MOTH
The way is but short: away!
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
As swift as lead, sir.
DON
MOTH
The meaning, pretty ingenious?
Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
DON
MOTH
I say lead is slow.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
You are too swift, sir, to say so:
Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?
DON
MOTH
Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he:
I shoot thee at the swain.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Thump then and I flee.
DON
MOTH
A most acute juvenal; voluble and free of grace!
By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face:
Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.
My herald is return'd.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.
DON
COSTARD
Some enigma, some riddle: come, thy l'envoy; begin.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
No enigma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the
mail, sir: O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain! no
l'envoy, no l'envoy; no salve, sir, but a plantain!
DON
MOTH
By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly
thought my spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes
me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my stars!
Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l'envoy, and
the word l'envoy for a salve?
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Do the wise think them other? is not l'envoy a salve?
DON
MOTH
No, page: it is an epilogue or discourse, to make plain
Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
I will example it:
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
Were still at odds, being but three.
There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.
DON
MOTH
          The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
Were still at odds, being but three.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
          Until the goose came out of door,
And stay'd the odds by adding four.
Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with
my l'envoy.
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
Were still at odds, being but three.
DON
MOTH
          Until the goose came out of door,
Staying the odds by adding four.
COSTARD
A good l'envoy, ending in the goose: would you
desire more?
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.
To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:
Let me see; a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.
DON
MOTH
Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?
COSTARD
By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
Then call'd you for the l'envoy.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
True, and I for a plantain: thus came your
argument in;
Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;
And he ended the market.
DON
MOTH
But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?
COSTARD
I will tell you sensibly.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak that l'envoy:
I Costard, running out, that was safely within,
Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.
DON
COSTARD
We will talk no more of this matter.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Till there be more matter in the shin.
DON
COSTARD
Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
O, marry me to one Frances: I smell some l'envoy,
some goose, in this.
DON
COSTARD
By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
enfreedoming thy person; thou wert immured,
restrained, captivated, bound.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
True, true; and now you will be my purgation and let me loose.
DON
MOTH
I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and,
in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this:
bear this significant
to the country maid Jaquenetta:
there is remuneration; for the best ward of mine
honour is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.
COSTARD
Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.
BIRON
My sweet ounce of man's flesh! my incony Jew!
Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration!
O, that's the Latin word for three farthings: three
farthings--remuneration.--'What's the price of this
inkle?'--'One penny.'--'No, I'll give you a
remuneration:' why, it carries it. Remuneration!
why, it is a fairer name than French crown. I will
never buy and sell out of this word.
COSTARD
O, my good knave Costard! exceedingly well met.
BIRON
Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man
buy for a remuneration?
COSTARD
What is a remuneration?
BIRON
Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.
COSTARD
Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.
BIRON
I thank your worship: God be wi' you!
COSTARD
Stay, slave; I must employ thee:
As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,
Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.
BIRON
When would you have it done, sir?
COSTARD
This afternoon.
BIRON
Well, I will do it, sir: fare you well.
COSTARD
Thou knowest not what it is.
BIRON
I shall know, sir, when I have done it.
COSTARD
Why, villain, thou must know first.
BIRON
I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.
COSTARD
It must be done this afternoon.
Hark, slave, it is but this:
The princess comes to hunt here in the park,
And in her train there is a gentle lady;
When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,
And Rosaline they call her: ask for her;
And to her white hand see thou do commend
This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.
BIRON
Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration,
a'leven-pence farthing better: most sweet gardon! I
will do it sir, in print. Gardon! Remuneration!
