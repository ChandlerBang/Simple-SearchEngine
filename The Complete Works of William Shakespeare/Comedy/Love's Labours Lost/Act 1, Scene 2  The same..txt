SCENE II. The same.
Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
DON
MOTH
Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit
grows melancholy?
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
DON
MOTH
Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
No, no; O Lord, sir, no.
DON
MOTH
How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my
tender juvenal?
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.
DON
MOTH
Why tough senior? why tough senior?
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?
DON
MOTH
I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
appertaining to thy young days, which we may
nominate tender.
ARMADO
And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your
old time, which we may name tough.
DON ADRIANO DE
MOTH
Pretty and apt.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or
I apt, and my saying pretty?
DON
MOTH
Thou pretty, because little.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?
DON
MOTH
And therefore apt, because quick.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Speak you this in my praise, master?
DON
MOTH
In thy condign praise.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
I will praise an eel with the same praise.
DON
MOTH
What, that an eel is ingenious?
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
That an eel is quick.
DON
MOTH
I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
I am answered, sir.
DON
MOTH
I love not to be crossed.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
[Aside]  He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.
DON
MOTH
I have promised to study three years with the duke.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
You may do it in an hour, sir.
DON
MOTH
Impossible.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
How many is one thrice told?
DON
MOTH
I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
DON
MOTH
I confess both: they are both the varnish of a
complete man.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum of
deuce-ace amounts to.
DON
MOTH
It doth amount to one more than two.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Which the base vulgar do call three.
DON
MOTH
True.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here
is three studied, ere ye'll thrice wink: and how
easy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' and
study three years in two words, the dancing horse
will tell you.
DON
MOTH
A most fine figure!
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
To prove you a cipher.
DON
MOTH
I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is
base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a
base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour
of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised
courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should
outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men
have been in love?
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Hercules, master.
DON
MOTH
Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name
more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good
repute and carriage.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great
carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back
like a porter: and he was in love.
DON
MOTH
O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do
excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's
love, my dear Moth?
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
A woman, master.
DON
MOTH
Of what complexion?
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.
DON
MOTH
Tell me precisely of what complexion.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Of the sea-water green, sir.
DON
MOTH
Is that one of the four complexions?
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.
DON
MOTH
Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a
love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason
for it. He surely affected her for her wit.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
DON
MOTH
My love is most immaculate white and red.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under
such colours.
DON
MOTH
Define, define, well-educated infant.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
My father's wit and my mother's tongue, assist me!
DON
MOTH
Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and
pathetical!
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     If she be made of white and red,
Her faults will ne'er be known,
For blushing cheeks by faults are bred
And fears by pale white shown:
Then if she fear, or be to blame,
By this you shall not know,
For still her cheeks possess the same
Which native she doth owe.
A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of
white and red.
DON
MOTH
Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
The world was very guilty of such a ballad some
three ages since: but I think now 'tis not to be
found; or, if it were, it would neither serve for
the writing nor the tune.
DON
MOTH
I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
example my digression by some mighty precedent.
Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the
park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
[Aside]  To be whipped; and yet a better love than
my master.
DON
MOTH
Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.
DON
MOTH
I say, sing.
DULL
Forbear till this company be past.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Sir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costard
safe: and you must suffer him to take no delight
nor no penance; but a' must fast three days a week.
For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: she
is allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well.
DON
JAQUENETTA
I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Man?
DON
JAQUENETTA
I will visit thee at the lodge.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
That's hereby.
DON
JAQUENETTA
I know where it is situate.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Lord, how wise you are!
DON
JAQUENETTA
I will tell thee wonders.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
With that face?
DON
JAQUENETTA
I love thee.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
So I heard you say.
DON
JAQUENETTA
And so, farewell.
DULL
Fair weather after you!
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Come, Jaquenetta, away!
DON
COSTARD
Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou
be pardoned.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a
full stomach.
DON
COSTARD
Thou shalt be heavily punished.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they
are but lightly rewarded.
DON
MOTH
Take away this villain; shut him up.
COSTARD
Come, you transgressing slave; away!
MOTH
Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.
COSTARD
No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.
MOTH
Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation
that I have seen, some shall see.
COSTARD
What shall some see?
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon.
It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their
words; and therefore I will say nothing: I thank
God I have as little patience as another man; and
therefore I can be quiet.
DON
