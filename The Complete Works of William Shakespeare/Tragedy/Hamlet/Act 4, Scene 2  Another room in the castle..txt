SCENE II. Another room in the castle.
Enter HAMLET
HAMLET
Safely stowed.
ROSENCRANTZ:
[Within]  Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
GUILDENSTERN:
What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
O, here they come.
HAMLET
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
ROSENCRANTZ
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
HAMLET
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
And bear it to the chapel.
ROSENCRANTZ
Do not believe it.
HAMLET
Believe what?
ROSENCRANTZ
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what
replication should be made by the son of a king?
HAMLET
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
ROSENCRANTZ
Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his
rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the
king best service in the end: he keeps them, like
an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to
be last swallowed: when he needs what you have
gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you
shall be dry again.
HAMLET
I understand you not, my lord.
ROSENCRANTZ
I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
foolish ear.
HAMLET
My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go
with us to the king.
ROSENCRANTZ
The body is with the king, but the king is not with
the body. The king is a thing--
HAMLET
A thing, my lord!
GUILDENSTERN
Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
HAMLET
